You wedge the pickaxe under a corner of the lid and push hard. It lurches open with a groan,
and a blast of dank air howls out of the opening. Slate steps lead down into a dark void below.

Descending into the blackness, you light a lamp and see that the walls are encrusted with carvings,
fossils, and bones. As the last rays of light from the entrance recede behind you, a stone floor appears
and the passage widens. You are now standing in a chasm filled with the skeletons of long-dead creatures.

You reach down and pick up a human skull. Its surface is riddled with lacerations that look like tooth marks.

Something growls behind you.
