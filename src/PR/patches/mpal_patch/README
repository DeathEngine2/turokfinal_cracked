Patch for Release 2.0* and 1.0*.
Fri Aug 16 15:29:48 PDT 1996

This simple script makes the Nintendo64 libultra libraries for MPAL.

You create 3 new libraries (libultra_mpal_rom.a, libultra_mpal_d.a, 
libultra_mpal.a) with this patch.

If you use these libraries, you can set MPAL mode instead of PAL mode.
This patch also updates rcp.h.  The new rcp.h is effective for NTSC and MPAL 
only.  So you must not use the new rcp.h for PAL.  The old rcp.h is saved
as rcp_pal.h.

To install this patch, run the script 'instpatch' as root.
