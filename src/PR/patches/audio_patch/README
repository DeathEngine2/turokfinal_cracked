Patch for Release 2.0E and 1.0I.
Mon Apr 29 14:40:23 PDT 1996

This simple script updates the Nintendo64 libultra libraries
with fixes for the following problems:

	- When the sound player or sequence player were
	  removed (to free system resources), the CPU interrupts
	  were disabled. This could cause various, serious problems
	  due to unserviced interrupts.

	- When the video system received an NMI, it attempted to
	  re-program video registers (to a default state) without
	  waiting for a video safe time to do so. This could leave the
	  video system in a hung state.

	- The reverb function of the audio library was not working
	  properly.


To install this patch, run the script 'instpatch' as root.

It will update /usr/lib/libultra*.a and /usr/include/PR/abi.h
