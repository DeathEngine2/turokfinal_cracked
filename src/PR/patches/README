Patches for 2.0E and 1.0I
Wed Aug 21 15:12:17 PDT 1996

This directory contains six patches to the 2.0E and 1.0I Nintendo64 
software development environment.

audio_patch/
contpak_patch/
ic_patch/
mkisprite_patch/
mpal_patch/
pal_patch/

All of these patches are automatically installed by the "inst" or "swmgr"
program, so it should not be necessary to install any of these manually.
However, if for some reason you do need to install an individual patch,
just run the script "instpatch" from inside the patch subdirectory, as 
superuser.
