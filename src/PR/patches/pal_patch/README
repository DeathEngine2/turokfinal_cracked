Patch for Release 2.0* and 1.0*.
Mon Jul 17 15:00:00 JST 1996

This simple script updates the Nintendo64 libultra libraries
with fixes for the following problems:

	- osViClock was VI_NTSC_CLOCK in spite of VI mode.

	!!Caution!!

If you used mpal_patch, you must recover "rcp.h" from backup file (rcp_pal.h)
Because mpal_patch changes VI_PAL_CLOCK value in "rcp.h" to MPAL value.

To install this patch, run the script 'instpatch' as root.

It will update /usr/lib/libultra*.a.
