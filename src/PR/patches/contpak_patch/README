 This is the patch for Pfs-Library (Controller Pak library) version Aug1396.

                                                   Nintendo Co., Ltd.  1996

* Aug0896->Aug1396

 These bugs are fixed.

   After you read data from a controller and then you called osPfsInit
   (osPfsIsPlug), you were not able to get correct data from a controller 
   by osContGetReadData.


* Jul2496->Aug0896

 These bugs are fixed.

   When you called osPfsWriteFile, it doesn't work if the data were
   more than 256 bytes.

   When you called osPfsInit (osPfsChecker), PFS_CORRUPETED was set
   in pfs.status.


* Jun2196->Jul2496

 These bugs are fixed.

   If you call some functions after you pulled out a Controller Pak 
   and inserted another Controller Pak, they never returned the value
   PFS_ERR_NEW_PACK.

   When game_code was 0 and company_code was not 0 (or game_code was 
   not 0 and company_code was 0), you couldn't find or erase the file.

   There was a bug in osPfsInit when the Controller Pak was not inserted.

   When a Controlller Pak was not installed and then you installed a 
   Controller Pak and called osPfsIsPlug, it didn't detect the new 
   Controller Pak.

   When you allocated a new file with osPfsAllocateFile and then called
   osPfsFindFile right away, you couldn't find the file you had 
   allocated.
